# ECSE-444-Labs

Lab1:
  - Built single-variable Kalman-Filter using ARM Assembly Language, C and CMSIS-DSP library.
  - Checked the derived results using functions like subtraction, mean, standard-deviation, convolution and correlation.
  - Checked time efficiency and optimization using SWV trace log implemented in STM32CubeIDE.
